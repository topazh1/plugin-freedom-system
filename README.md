## Why This Exists

Traditional plugin development demands deep expertise in C++, DSP algorithms, and the JUCE framework. This barrier keeps plugin creation restricted to experienced programmers, leaving musicians, producers, and sound designers dependent on commercial tools.

The Plugin Freedom System removes that barrier entirely.

By enabling conversational plugin development, this system:

- **Democratizes creation**: Anyone with an idea can build it, regardless of technical background
- **Prioritizes creativity**: Focus on sonic goals and UX, not implementation details
- **Accelerates iteration**: Ideas become working plugins in hours, not weeks
- **Removes gatekeeping**: Opens audio software development to the people who actually use these tools

## What You Can Build

- **Effects**: Reverbs, delays, distortion, modulation, filters, dynamics processors
- **Synthesizers**: Subtractive, FM, wavetable, granular, additive
- **Utilities**: Analyzers, meters, routing tools, MIDI processors
- **Experimental**: Custom DSP algorithms, hybrid processors, generative tools

All plugins compile to native VST3/AU formats compatible with any DAW (Ableton, Logic, Reaper, etc.).

## How It Works

### 1. Dream (`/dream`)

Brainstorm your plugin concept through conversation:
- **Creative brief** - Vision, sonic goals, UX principles
- **Parameter specification** - All controls, ranges, and mappings
- **UI mockups** - Visual design and layout

### 2. Plan (`/plan`)

Research and design the technical architecture:
- **DSP architecture** - Signal flow and processing strategy
- **Implementation plan** - Technical approach and complexity analysis

### 3. Implement (`/implement`)

Transform your specifications into a fully functional plugin through an automated workflow:

- **Build System Ready** (Stage 1): Project structure, CMake configuration, and all parameters implemented - validated automatically
- **Audio Engine Working** (Stage 2): DSP algorithms and audio processing complete - validated automatically
- **UI Integrated** (Stage 3): WebView interface connected to audio engine (or skip for headless plugins) - validated automatically with runtime tests
- After Stage 3 validation passes: Plugin complete, ready to install

### 4. Deploy & Iterate

- `/install-plugin` - Install to system folders for DAW use
- `/test` - Run automated validation suite
- `/improve` - Add features or fix bugs (with regression testing)
- `/reconcile` - Reconcile state between planning and implementation

## Modern Interface Design

Plugins use web-based interfaces (HTML/CSS/JS) rendered via JUCE's WebView instead of traditional GUI frameworks. This enables:

- **Rapid prototyping**: See design changes instantly without rebuilding
- **Modern aesthetics**: Leverage contemporary web design patterns and animations
- **Interactive mockups**: Test and refine interfaces before implementation
- **Familiar tools**: Use web technologies many creators already understand
- **Responsive layouts**: Easily adapt UIs to different sizes and contexts

### GUI-Optional Workflow

Plugins can skip custom UI and ship as "headless" plugins using DAW-provided controls:

- **Faster iteration**: Test DSP immediately without waiting for UI implementation
- **Progressive enhancement**: Add custom UI later via `/improve`
- **Flexibility**: Decide when/if to build visual interface
- **Zero overhead**: Smaller binary, faster compile, all parameters exposed to DAW

## Key Features

### Automated Build Pipeline

7-phase build system (`scripts/build-and-install.sh`) handles validation, compilation, installation, and verification. No manual CMake commands or Xcode configuration required.

### Quality Assurance

- Automatic validation after each stage (compile-time + runtime tests)
- validation-agent runs pluginval automatically (VST3/AU validation)
- Validation is blocking - errors must be fixed before progressing
- Regression testing on modifications
- Backup verification before destructive operations
- Build failure detection and troubleshooting

### Knowledge Base

Dual-indexed troubleshooting database (`troubleshooting/`) captures solutions to build failures, runtime issues, GUI problems, and API misuse. The system learns from every problem encountered.

**Required Reading** (`juce8-critical-patterns.md`) automatically prevents repeat mistakes by injecting proven patterns into all subagent contexts.

### Graduated Research Protocol

3-level investigation system (`/research`) for complex problems:

- **Quick**: Single-agent targeted investigation (1-2 min)
- **Moderate**: Multi-agent parallel search (3-5 min)
- **Deep**: Comprehensive multi-level analysis (5-10 min)

### Version Management

- Semantic versioning on improvements
- Git-based state tracking
- Safe rollback capabilities
- Backup verification before destructive operations

### Workflow Modes

- **Manual mode** (default): Present decision menus at each checkpoint for full control
- **Express mode**: Auto-progress through implementation stages without intermediate menus
- **Configurable**: Set preferences in `.claude/preferences.json` or use `--express`/`--manual` flags
- **Safe**: Express mode drops to manual on any error, ensuring oversight when needed

### Lifecycle Management

- `/install-plugin` - Deploy to system folders
- `/uninstall` - Remove binaries (keep source)
- `/reset-to-ideation` - Roll back to concept stage
- `/destroy` - Complete removal with verified backup
- `/clean` - Interactive cleanup menu

## System Architecture

### Contracts (Single Source of Truth)

Every plugin has immutable contracts in `plugins/[Name]/.ideas/`:

- `creative-brief.md` - Vision, sonic goals, UX principles
- `parameter-spec.md` - Complete parameter definitions
- `architecture.md` - DSP design and signal flow
- `plan.md` - Implementation strategy
- `ui-mockups/` - Visual design references

**Zero drift**: All stages reference the same specs. No "telephone game" across workflows.

### Dispatcher Pattern

Each implementation stage runs in a fresh subagent context:

- `foundation-shell-agent` (Stage 1) - Project structure and parameter management
- `dsp-agent` (Stage 2) - Audio processing
- `gui-agent` (Stage 3) - WebView UI
- `validation-agent` (after each stage) - Automatic validation with runtime tests

**No context accumulation**: Clean separation prevents cross-contamination and keeps token usage minimal.

### Discovery Through Play

All features discoverable via:

- Slash command autocomplete (type `/` in Claude Code)
- Numbered decision menus at checkpoints
- Interactive skill prompts

**No manual required**: Learn by exploring, not reading docs.

### Checkpoint Protocol

At every completion point:

1. Auto-commit changes
2. Update state files (`.continue-here.md`, `PLUGINS.md`)
3. Present numbered decision menu
4. Wait for user response
5. Execute chosen action

**Never auto-proceeds**: You stay in control.

## Philosophy

This system treats plugin development as a **creative conversation**, not a coding task.

You describe the sound, behavior, and appearance you want. The system handles the technical complexity—DSP implementation, parameter management, UI rendering, build configuration, validation, deployment.

**Focus on what matters**: Creating tools that serve your music.

## Feedback Loop

The complete improvement cycle:

```
Build → Test → Find Issue → Research → Improve → Document → Validate → Deploy
    ↑                                                                      ↓
    └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **deep-research** finds solutions (graduated 3-level protocol)
- **plugin-improve** applies changes (with regression testing)
- **troubleshooting-docs** captures knowledge (dual-indexed for fast lookup)
- **ui-mockup finalization** auto-updates brief (treats mockup as source of truth)
- **plugin-lifecycle** manages deployment (cache clearing, verification)
- **Required Reading** prevents repeat mistakes (auto-injected into subagents)

Every problem encountered becomes institutional knowledge. The system learns and improves over time.
