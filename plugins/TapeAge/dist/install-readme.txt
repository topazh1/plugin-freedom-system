FIRST USE - IMPORTANT (macOS Security)

macOS will show a security warning on first use because this plugin is
not notarized by Apple. This is normal for independent plugins.

To authorize TapeAge:

1. Open your DAW (Logic Pro, Ableton, FL Studio, etc.)
2. Try to load TapeAge on an audio track
3. macOS will block it with a security warning dialog
4. Open System Settings > Privacy & Security
5. Scroll down to the Security section
6. Click "Open Anyway" next to the TapeAge warning
7. Confirm you want to open it
8. Return to your DAW and try loading TapeAge again
9. Click "Open" when prompted

This is a ONE-TIME process for each plugin format (VST3 and AU).
After authorization, TapeAge will load normally every time.
