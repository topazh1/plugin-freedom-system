# Stage 4 Phase 4.2 Complete - Parameter Binding

All 5 parameters bound with bidirectional sync (UI ↔ DSP):
- ✅ 5 WebSliderRelay instances created (sweep, time, attack, decay, drive)
- ✅ 5 WebSliderParameterAttachment instances created
- ✅ Relay and attachment initialization implemented (Pattern #11, #12)
- ✅ Member order: Relays → WebView → Attachments (Pattern #11)
- ✅ Three-parameter constructor: (parameter, relay, nullptr) - Pattern #12

**Build successful:**
- VST3 format built (ad-hoc signed)
- AU format built
- Standalone format built
- Universal binary (arm64 + x86_64)

**Pattern compliance:**
- Pattern #11: Member order (Relays → WebView → Attachments)
- Pattern #12: Three-parameter attachment constructor
- Pattern #15: valueChangedEvent with getNormalisedValue() (in HTML)
- Pattern #21: type="module" on script tags (in HTML)

**Known issue:**
- HTML uses absolute drag (sweepStartY) instead of relative drag (lastY) - Pattern #16 violation
- Can be fixed in Phase 5.3 (optional polish)

**Next:** Stage 4 Phase 4.3 (Polish - fix drag pattern, add value displays) - OPTIONAL
Or skip to Stage 5 (Validation) if current UX acceptable
