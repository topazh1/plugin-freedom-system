# Parameter Specification: LushPad

**CRITICAL CONTRACT:** This specification is immutable during implementation. Stage 1 Planning cannot proceed without this file. All subsequent stages reference these exact parameters.

**Generated by:** UI mockup finalization (ui-mockup skill, v2)
**Generated date:** 2025-11-13
**Referenced by:** Stage 1 (Planning), Stage 2 (Shell), Stage 3 (DSP), Stage 4 (GUI)

## Total Parameter Count

**Total:** 3 parameters

## Parameter Definitions

### timbre
- **Type:** Float
- **Range:** 0.0 to 1.0
- **Default:** 0.35
- **Skew Factor:** linear (1.0)
- **UI Control:** Rotary knob, left position (96px from left edge)
- **DSP Usage:** Controls FM feedback depth AND harmonic saturation. Subtle random motion around the set position creates evolving timbre. Max value carefully tuned to stay musical.

### filter_cutoff
- **Type:** Float
- **Range:** 20.0 to 20000.0 Hz
- **Default:** 2000.0
- **Skew Factor:** 0.3 (logarithmic scaling for frequency perception)
- **UI Control:** Rotary knob, center position (244px from left edge)
- **DSP Usage:** Low-pass filter brightness (12dB/octave, fixed subtle resonance). Affected by MIDI velocity (softer notes = darker sound). Controls the cutoff frequency of the filter that shapes the harmonic content.

### reverb_amount
- **Type:** Float
- **Range:** 0.0 to 1.0 (dry/wet mix)
- **Default:** 0.4
- **Skew Factor:** linear (1.0)
- **UI Control:** Rotary knob, right position (392px from left edge)
- **DSP Usage:** Large hall reverb wet/dry mix. Spacious, lush, expansive character. 0.0 = fully dry (no reverb), 1.0 = fully wet (100% reverb).

## Parameter Groups

**Tone Shaping:**
- timbre
- filter_cutoff

**Spatial Processing:**
- reverb_amount

## UI Layout (from v2-ui.yaml)

**Window dimensions:** 600×300 pixels (fixed size)

**Control positions (absolute positioning):**
- Timbre: x=96px, y=100px
- Filter Cutoff: x=244px, y=100px
- Reverb Amount: x=392px, y=100px

**Visual style:**
- Neomorphic soft design with warm cream gradient (#d4c4b0 to #b8a690)
- Minimal aesthetic (no value displays by default)
- Subtle modulation glow behind knobs (pulsing animation)
- Knob diameter: 80px with indicator line

## Notes

- Parameters are implemented in EXACT order during Stage 2 (Shell)
- Parameter IDs must remain consistent across all stages (timbre, filter_cutoff, reverb_amount)
- UI controls implemented from v2 mockup during Stage 4 (GUI)
- Filter cutoff uses logarithmic scaling (skew 0.3) for natural frequency perception
- All parameters are continuous (no stepped/discrete values)
- No Choice or Bool parameters in this plugin (all Float sliders)

## DSP Architecture Context

**From creative-brief.md:**

LushPad is a polyphonic pad synthesizer with generative modulation. The 3 user-facing parameters control a complex underlying system:

- **Timbre** affects both FM feedback (sine wave self-modulation) and harmonic saturation
- **Filter Cutoff** controls the brightness of the final output, with velocity scaling
- **Reverb Amount** mixes the dry signal with a large hall reverb

**Hidden modulation system** (not exposed as parameters):
- Random LFOs modulating panning, feedback depth, saturation amount
- Nested modulation where LFO speeds and depths are themselves modulated
- Creates constantly evolving, generative texture that never repeats

This parameter specification defines ONLY the user-facing controls. The hidden modulation system is implemented in Stage 3 (DSP) without user-adjustable parameters.
